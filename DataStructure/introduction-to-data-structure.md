# Intoduction to Data Sturcture

## what is Data Structure?

A Data stucture is a data organization. management and storage format that enables effiecient access and modication. More precisely, a data stucture is a collection of data values, the relationships among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Types of Data structures

- Composite types or non-Premitive type
  . A Composite data type or compound data type is a data type which can be constructed in a program using the programming language's primitive data types.

- Abstract Data Type (ADT)
  . An Abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model of data types, defined by it's behavior from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of the possible values, possible operations on the data of this type. and the behavior of these operations this mathematical model constrasts with data structurtres.

## Data Structures type(Based on behavior)

- Linear Data structures (Arrays, Lists)
- Trees
- Hash-Based Structures
- Graphs
- Others(Light-Map, Winged edge, routing table, etc)
