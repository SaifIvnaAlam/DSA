# Linear Data stucture

## What is linear Data Structure?

A Linear Data structure is a known as a data structure that allows data elements to be arranged in a sequential or linear fashion. Each element is attached with its next and previous adjacent. a Liinear data strcuture is only has one level and preforms linear search in the data structure

- Linear data structures store and organize data in linear or sequential manner.

## Types of Linear Data Structure

- Array

An Array is a type of framework that stores homogeneous parts in connected memory locations. it is precisely the sa,e kinds of objects that are saved sequentially inside an array. The fundamental concept behind linear arrys in the data structure is that multuoke piecess of data similar can be stored togather. Before savinf the data in an arry. it is essential that the size of an array need to be established.Every asspect of the array can be accessed or modified and the data is stored in an index to identify their places od their own.

- Linked-List

A Linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference link to the next node in the list. The first node is called the head of the list and the last node is called the tail of the list. The head of the list is the first node in the list and the tail of the list is the last node in the list.
